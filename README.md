# labels

This repository provides a set of labels that I use my public repositories.

You can find a list of the labels in YAML format in the [labels.yml][labels] file.

## Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **This repository is not maintained for public use.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Using the [labels.yml][labels] file in your projects with automation tools like
[EndBug/label-sync][label-sync] may lead to unintended consequences. It is much
safer to copy the contents of this file to your project or create your own repo
with similar content.

## Credits

This project was inspired by the work of the Federico Grandi ([@EndBug][EndBug]),
